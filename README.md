## LinearRegression
This linear regression model was built in Python via Jupyter, though is also tested and compatible with Google Colab.

## Features
- Takes an external .csv file of automobiles
- Predicts the miles per gallon based on horsepower and manufacturing year
- Calculates P-value, R squared value, slope, and intercept.
- Plots points on a graph with a trend line.

## Setup
1. Download both the .ipynb and .csv files.
2. If using Jupyter, import the .ipynb and .csv files so that they're in the same path.
3. If using Google Colab, import the .csv file under the File tab.
4. Run every segment in order with Ctrl-Enter.
