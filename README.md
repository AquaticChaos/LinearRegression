## LinearRegression
This linear regression model was built in Python via Jupyter, though is also tested and compatible with Google Colab.
The program takes an external .csv files of hundreds of automobiles, and attempts to predict the miles per gallon based on its horsepower and manufacturing year.
It will also calculate the P-value, R squared value, slope and intercept, and then graph the points.

## Setup
1. Download both the .ipynb and .csv files.
2. If using Jupyter, import the .ipynb and .csv files so that they're in the same path.
3. If using Google Colab, import the .csv file under the File tab.
4. Run every segment in order with Ctrl-Enter.
